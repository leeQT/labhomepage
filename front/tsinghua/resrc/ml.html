                  <p>Complex data correlation modelling and representation plays an important role in many
                    applications, such as social media analysis, data classification and medical diagnosis. Here, we
                    focus on graph/hypergraph based learning, hypergraph neural networks, multi-modal data fusion,
                    metric learning and cost-sensitive learning methods, and their applications on visual
                    classification, software defect prediction, and social media data filtering and recommendation.</p>

                    <p>The hypergraph is a generalization of a graph, which is composed of a vertex set and a hyperedge
                      set. In a hypergraph, each hyperedge can connect any number of vertices, and the hyperedge can be
                      easily expanded, which leads to a flexible edge degree for hypergraph. Therefore, the hypergraph
                      model is able to formulate the high-order correlation of data compared with the simple graph and
                      other linear comparison methods. Due to this advantage, hypergraph learning method has attracted
                      much attention in recent years and has been applied in many tasks, such as image retrieval,
                      object classification, image segmentation, multimedia recommendation and visual tracking.</p>

                      <p>In our work, we propose a hypergraph analysis approach for 3-D object retrieval and
                        recognition. In particular, we construct multiple hypergraphs for a set of 3-D objects based on
                        their 2-D views. Therefore, our method can explore the higher order relationship among objects
                        and does not use the distance between objects. We conduct experiments on the National Taiwan
                        University 3-D model dataset and the ETH 3-D object collection. Experimental results
                        demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art
                        methods.</p>

                      <p>Due to the popularity of social media websites, extensive research efforts have been dedicated
                        to tag-based social image search. In our work, we propose an approach that simultaneously
                        utilizes both visual and textual information to estimate the relevance of user tagged images.
                        The relevance estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. Comparative results
                        of the experiments conducted on a dataset including 370+ images are presented, which
                        demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

                      <p>In all existing works, the performance of hypergraph learning highly depends on the generated
                        hypergraph structure. In our work, we propose the first dynamic hypergraph structure learning
                        method. Given the originally generated hypergraph structure, the objective of our work is to
                        simultaneously optimize the label projection matrix (the common task in hypergraph learning)
                        and the hypergraph structure itself. We have applied the proposed method in the tasks of 3D
                        shape recognition and gesture recognition. Experimental results on four public datasets show
                        better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                      <p>In our work, we aim to conduct 3D object recognition using multi-modal information through a
                        cross diffusion process on multi-hypergraph structure. Given multi-modal representations of 3D
                        objects, the correlation among these objects is formulated using the multi-hypergraph
                        structure. We propose a cross diffusion process on multi-hypergraph, in which the label
                        information is propagated from multiple hypergraphs alternatively. We have applied the proposed
                        method in 3D object recognition using multiple representations. Experimental results
                        demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve satisfied multi-modal combination performance

                      <p></p>
                      <p>In this paper, we present a hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) framework for data
                        representation
                        learning, which can encode high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure. Confronting
                        the
                        challenges of learning representation for complex data in real practice, we propose to
                        incorporate such data structure in a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling,
                        especially when dealing with complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is
                        designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way,
                        traditional
                        hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations
                        efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order
                        data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have
                        conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks
                        and
                        compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods. Experimental
                        results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.
                        We
                        can also reveal from the results that the proposed HGNN is superior when dealing with
                        multi-modal
                        data compared with existing methods.</p>

                      <p>Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), targeting at measuring the many-to-many distances, has shown its
                        superiority and been widely applied in computer vision tasks. However, there is still little
                        effort concentrated on optimizing the EMD metric towards better matching performance. To tackle
                        this issue, we propose an EMD metric learning algorithm in this work. This method is able to
                        generate a discriminative ground distance matrix which can further improve the EMD distance
                        measurement. We then apply our EMD metric learning method on two tasks, i.e., multiview object
                        classification and document classification. The experimental results have shown better
                        performance of our proposed EMD metric learning method compared with the traditional EMD method
                        and the state-of-the-art methods. It is noted that the proposed EMD metric learning method can
                        be also used in other applications.</p>

                      <p>Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), which is widely used to measure the similarity between two
                        distributions, plays an important role in machine learning. However, in practice, the
                        conventional KLD may not always obtain a satisfying performance on measuring the similarity
                        between two distributions because the current observed distributions may not be the best
                        representation for the data. To address this problem, we propose a KLD metric learning
                        algorithm, which aims at learning a best linear mapping and obtaining the best KLD to well
                        express the similarity of data distributions by optimizing such linear mapping. Such learned
                        KLD metric achieves better performance on measuring the difference between distributions, i.e.,
                        makes the data distributions easier to classify. Also, we develop an intrinsic steepest descent
                        method, which preserves the manifold structure of the metric in the iteration to solve this

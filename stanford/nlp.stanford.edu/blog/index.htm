Thanks to them all for being a part of the group and for their amazing contributions! We asked all the graduates to give us a few words about what they did here and where they&#39;re headed - check it out!</p>

					<p>We apply NLP to mental health by doing a large-scale analysis of text-message-based crisis counseling conversations. We develop a set of discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of the conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Using these, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with successful counseling.</p>
